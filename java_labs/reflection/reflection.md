# What is Reflection?
  Reflection is the ability of program to introspect, modify its own structure and behavior at runtime.

# What is Introspection?
 Introspection is the ability of a program to query or obtain information about itself.

# What is Intercession(Inter - ce - ssion) ?
 The ability of a program to modify its execution state, modify its behavior , Or add new behavior as it is executing is called  intercession.  

# Reflection is further divided into two categories -
   1. Structural reflection
   2. Behavioral reflection

# Structural Reflection - 
 The ability of a program to introspect, modify or add new data structure to its own structure is Structural Reflection.

# Behavioral Reflection
 The ability of a program to introspect, modify  runtime environment is behavioral reflection.  

   
# Java Structural Reflection?
   introspection - Java provides an ability to obtain class information about an object at runtime. This information includes fields, methods, modifiers and super class information.
   intercession - in a limited way. Java lets you create instance of class, invoke methods on this instance. However java does not allow you to change the data structure of an object at runtime example, you cannot add a field or method to object at runtime.

# Java Behavioral Reflection?
   intercession is the ability to change the method execution at runtime or add a new method to a class at runtime. Java does not provide behavioral intercession features.

The reflection facility in Java is provided through the reflection API. Most of the reflection API classes and interfaces are in the java.lang.reflect package
